# Semantic-Search-Engine

**Course Intro**: A 400-level advanced coding class(web crawling & search engine) which are cross-listed as open to both undergraduates and graduate students, itâ€™s challenging for an undergraduate student and requires much effort. 

**Final project & Data**: Dynamically scrapped article resources with BFS web crawler, built web interface to return top 25 most relevant articles for query terms based on ranking of TF-IDF scores to users

**Tools & Techniques**: Python, Web Scraping(urllib.request, Beautiful Soup), NLP(re, nltk, collections), Web Interface(cgi), scikit-learn.

**Deliverables**:
